## Architecture Overview

Below is a high-level illustration of the system architecture, inspired by Airbnb's modular approach:

```
+-------------------+      +-------------------+      +-------------------+
|    Frontend App   | <--> |   Django Backend  | <--> |      MySQL DB     |
+-------------------+      +-------------------+      +-------------------+
         |                        |                            |
         |   GraphQL/REST API     |   ORM/SQL Queries          |
         |----------------------->|--------------------------->|
         |                        |                            |
         |   Auth, Data, Logic    |   Data Storage/Retrieval   |
```

## Database Design

Key entities and their relationships:

```
[User] 1---* [Property] 1---* [Booking] *---1 [Payment]
   |                |                |
   |                |                *---* [Review]
   |                |
   *---* [Review]   |
```

### Entities

- **User**
  - `id`, `name`, `email`, `password_hash`, `role`
- **Property**
  - `id`, `owner_id`, `title`, `location`, `price`
- **Booking**
  - `id`, `user_id`, `property_id`, `start_date`, `end_date`
- **Review**
  - `id`, `user_id`, `property_id`, `rating`, `comment`
- **Payment**
  - `id`, `booking_id`, `amount`, `status`, `timestamp`

**Relationships:**

- A user can own multiple properties.
- A property can have multiple bookings and reviews.
- A booking is linked to one user and one property.
- A payment is linked to one booking.

---

## Feature Breakdown

- **User Management:**  
  Handles registration, authentication, and profile management for guests and hosts. Ensures secure access and personalized experiences.

- **Property Management:**  
  Allows hosts to list, update, and manage properties, including details, pricing, and availability.

- **Booking System:**  
  Enables users to search for properties, make reservations, and manage their bookings.

- **Review System:**  
  Facilitates feedback by allowing users to leave reviews and ratings for properties and hosts.

- **Payment Processing:**  
  Integrates secure payment gateways to handle booking payments and refunds.

---

## API Security

Key security measures:

- **Authentication:**  
  Ensures only registered users can access protected endpoints (e.g., JWT, OAuth).

- **Authorization:**  
  Restricts actions based on user roles (e.g., only hosts can manage properties).

- **Rate Limiting:**  
  Prevents abuse by limiting the number of requests per user/IP.

- **Input Validation & Sanitization:**  
  Protects against SQL injection, XSS, and other vulnerabilities.

**Why Security Matters:**  
Protecting user data, securing financial transactions, and maintaining platform trust are critical for any booking platform.

---

## CI/CD Pipeline

**What is CI/CD?**  
Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) automate the process of testing, building, and deploying code, ensuring rapid and reliable delivery.

**Tools to be Used:**
- **GitHub Actions:** Automates testing and deployment workflows.
- **Docker:** Ensures consistent environments across development and production.

**Benefits:**  
Reduces manual errors, accelerates release cycles, and maintains high code quality.
